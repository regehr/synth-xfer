# Transfer Function Playbook (`<DOMAIN>`, `<OP>`)

Implement or improve one transfer function in this repo.

## Scope Per Task (Hard Rule)

- Work on exactly one abstract domain and one operation at a time.
- Allowed domains: `KnownBits`, `UConstRange` (unsigned constant range), `SConstRange` (signed constant range).
- If asked to handle multiple domains or multiple ops, split that into separate tasks and run this playbook once per `(domain, op)` pair.

## Key Clarifications

- In real world use cases, the transfer functions you are creating will often by used at high bitwidths such as 32 or 64. You must avoid the temptation to create specialized solutions that primarily provide precision at lower widths. Focus on the more general case of high bitwidth. What you are specifically looking for is that the exhaustive checks ``--exact-bw 5` `--exact-bw 6` `--exact-bw 7` `--exact-bw 8` do not show a significant downward trend in precision. You can also directly examine precision at high bitwidths, for example `--norm-bw 64,10000,1000` to look at high-bitwidth precision. For these norms, lower values are better.
- CI integration is not required for this task.
- Primary tools are `verify-upto` and `eval-final`.
- If you need to inspect one specific abstract input pair, use `eval-point` for a single-point transfer evaluation.
- `eval-final` default/final setting is: `--exact-bw 7 --norm-bw 64,10000,1000`.
- For faster intermediate feedback, you may run `eval-final` with `--exact-bw 6` (keep `--norm-bw 64,10000,1000`).
- `eval-final` outputs are not comparable across different `--exact-bw` values; only compare runs that use the same `--exact-bw`.
- For `verify-upto`, always use `--bw 64`.
- To reduce runtime during intermediate checks, lower `--timeout` instead of lowering `--bw`.
- You may optionally suggest concrete missing `transfer` dialect integer ops that would enable better precision or efficiency.

## Placeholder Conventions

- `<DOMAIN>`: one of `KnownBits`, `UConstRange`, `SConstRange`.
- `<OP>`: concrete op filename stem in `mlir/Operations` (case-sensitive), e.g. `Shl`.
- `<op>`: lowercase stem used in transfer filenames under `tests/data`, e.g. `shl`.

## Tool Bug Policy (Required)

- If you hit a bug in any tool in this repository (for example `verify-upto`, `eval-final`, `sxf`, lowering, or parsing), stop normal transfer-function work immediately.
- Report the bug clearly to the user first (minimal reproducer command, observed behavior, traceback/signature, and any relevant output paths/log files).
- Do not attempt a workaround by default.
- Mining logs/artifacts from the failed run is allowed, but only after the bug has been reported to the user.
- Only proceed with a workaround if the user explicitly asks for one after the bug report.
- If a workaround is requested, keep it scoped and temporary, and clearly label which results were obtained under workaround conditions.

## Shared Requirements

1. Match the transfer function arity to the concrete op in `mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir`.
   - If `concrete_op` takes `N` integer inputs, the transfer must take `N` abstract-value inputs and return one abstract value.
   - Keep the per-argument abstract type as `!transfer.abs_value<[!transfer.integer, !transfer.integer]>`.
   - Typical shapes:

```mlir
(!transfer.abs_value<[!transfer.integer, !transfer.integer]>) -> !transfer.abs_value<[!transfer.integer, !transfer.integer]>
(!transfer.abs_value<[!transfer.integer, !transfer.integer]>, !transfer.abs_value<[!transfer.integer, !transfer.integer]>) -> !transfer.abs_value<[!transfer.integer, !transfer.integer]>
(!transfer.abs_value<[!transfer.integer, !transfer.integer]>, !transfer.abs_value<[!transfer.integer, !transfer.integer]>, !transfer.abs_value<[!transfer.integer, !transfer.integer]>) -> !transfer.abs_value<[!transfer.integer, !transfer.integer]>
```

2. Transfer must be sound and as precise as possible.
3. Keep code bitwidth-agnostic.
4. Keep solver timeout at or below `120` seconds. It is fine to use lower timeouts to quickly ascertain the soundness of intermediate or partial transfer functions, but use `--timeout 120` for your final reported `verify-upto` run.
5. Keep changes minimal and repo-consistent.
6. Reuse existing transfer primitives whenever possible.

## Construction Strategy (Recommended)

- Prefer composing the final transfer as the meet of several simpler transfer functions, each capturing one sound insight.
- Keep each candidate independently sound; the meet of sound candidates is also sound.
- Typical candidates include:
  - exact special cases (`lhs == 0`, `rhs == 0`, both operands constant),
  - validity/feasibility filters (e.g., whether the op constraints allow any concrete pair in-range),
  - monotonic endpoint bounds valid under explicit guards (sign-partitioned or no-overflow conditions).
- When encoding a meet in-range domains, use domain-consistent intersection logic (e.g., lower via `smax`/`umax`, upper via `smin`/`umin` as appropriate).

## Optional Idea Mining with `sxf` (5-minute Budget)

- If progress stalls, use `sxf` to generate ideas, not final code.
- Cap runtime to about 5 minutes:

```bash
timeout 300 sxf mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir \
  -o /tmp/<DOMAIN>_<OP>_ideas \
  -d <DOMAIN> \
  --num-iters 1 \
  --num-steps 600 \
  --num-mcmc 80 \
  --program-length 40 \
  --condition-length 12 \
  --num-abd-procs 0 \
  --num-unsound-candidates 0 \
  --vbw 1-16 \
  --random-seed <seed>
```

- To get the most from this command:
  - If `timeout` is unavailable on your system, use `gtimeout` with the same arguments.
  - Run 2-3 different seeds and compare recurring patterns.
  - Keep `--num-iters 1`; in this workflow you want candidate ideas quickly, not a full synthesis run.
  - Use moderate `--num-steps`/`--num-mcmc` (for example, `400-1200` and `60-120`) to trade breadth vs. depth.
  - Inspect `/tmp/<DOMAIN>_<OP>_ideas/info.log` and `/tmp/<DOMAIN>_<OP>_ideas/debug.log` for high-precision partial candidates and reusable guard patterns.
  - Treat mined snippets as hypotheses: manually simplify, convert to meet-style sub-transfers, then re-check with `verify-upto`.
  - If `sxf` fails or times out, partial logs can still be useful for extracting ideas.
  - If the failure appears to be a tool bug, first report the bug per the Tool Bug Policy, then mine the failed-run logs.

## SSA IR Discipline (Important)

- This MLIR parser uses strict SSA form: each `%name = ...` must be an operation result.
- Do not write alias assignments like `%x = %y : !transfer.integer`.
- If you need another reference, reuse the original SSA value directly.
- After drafting a transfer file, run a quick timeout-limited `verify-upto` first (still with `--bw 64`) to catch parser/syntax issues, then run your final `--timeout 120` check.

## Domain-Specific Mapping

Choose one row only for a given task.

| Domain | File | Symbol | Encoding |
|---|---|---|---|
| `KnownBits` | `tests/data/kb_<op>.mlir` | `kb_<op>` | index `0` = known-zero mask, index `1` = known-one mask |
| `UConstRange` | `tests/data/ucr_<op>.mlir` | `ucr_<op>` | index `0` = lower bound, index `1` = upper bound |
| `SConstRange` | `tests/data/scr_<op>.mlir` | `scr_<op>` | index `0` = lower bound, index `1` = upper bound |

## Domain-Specific Primitive Guidance

- `KnownBits`: prefer `transfer.and`, `transfer.or`, `transfer.xor`, `transfer.add`, `transfer.sub`, `transfer.shl`, `transfer.lshr`, `transfer.constant`, `transfer.get_all_ones`.
- `UConstRange` and `SConstRange`: same as above, plus `transfer.cmp`, `transfer.select`, and overflow predicates such as `transfer.uadd_overflow`, `transfer.sadd_overflow`, and `transfer.ssub_overflow` when useful.

## Command Templates

Run only the commands for your chosen domain.
Optional `sxf` idea-mining above is still allowed and does not conflict with this rule.

KnownBits:

```bash
verify-upto --xfer-file tests/data/kb_<op>.mlir --bw 64 --timeout 120 --domain KnownBits --op mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir
eval-final tests/data/kb_<op>.mlir --domain KnownBits --op mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir --exact-bw 7 --norm-bw 64,10000,1000
# Optional faster intermediate feedback (not comparable to --exact-bw 7 runs):
# eval-final tests/data/kb_<op>.mlir --domain KnownBits --op mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir --exact-bw 6 --norm-bw 64,10000,1000
```

Unsigned ConstantRange (`UConstRange`):

```bash
verify-upto --xfer-file tests/data/ucr_<op>.mlir --bw 64 --timeout 120 --domain UConstRange --op mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir
eval-final tests/data/ucr_<op>.mlir --domain UConstRange --op mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir --exact-bw 7 --norm-bw 64,10000,1000
# Optional faster intermediate feedback (not comparable to --exact-bw 7 runs):
# eval-final tests/data/ucr_<op>.mlir --domain UConstRange --op mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir --exact-bw 6 --norm-bw 64,10000,1000
```

Signed ConstantRange (`SConstRange`):

```bash
verify-upto --xfer-file tests/data/scr_<op>.mlir --bw 64 --timeout 120 --domain SConstRange --op mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir
eval-final tests/data/scr_<op>.mlir --domain SConstRange --op mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir --exact-bw 7 --norm-bw 64,10000,1000
# Optional faster intermediate feedback (not comparable to --exact-bw 7 runs):
# eval-final tests/data/scr_<op>.mlir --domain SConstRange --op mlir/Operations/<OP>.mlir --exact-bw 6 --norm-bw 64,10000,1000
```

## Testing Guidance

- Use `verify-upto` as the soundness oracle with a 120-second timeout.
- `verify-upto` checks bitwidths from `1` up to the requested max width, and stops early on the first `timeout`.
- Use `eval-final` as the precision/quality metric. This command might be slow, but you must let it finish. Don't time this one out.
- For intermediate speed, you may use `--exact-bw 6`; default/final reporting should use `--exact-bw 7` unless task-specific instructions say otherwise.
- Never compare `eval-final` values across runs that used different `--exact-bw` values.
- Always use `--bw 64` for `verify-upto`.
- For faster intermediate feedback from `verify-upto`, lower `--timeout` (never lower `--bw`). For final reporting, use `--timeout 120`.

## Optional Test File Updates (Only If Asked)

KnownBits:
- `tests/test_verif.py`: `test_verif_kb_<op>()`
- `tests/test_jit.py`: `test_jit_with_kb_<op>()`

UConstRange:
- `tests/test_verif.py`: `test_verif_ucr_<op>()`
- `tests/test_jit.py`: `test_jit_with_ucr_<op>()`

SConstRange:
- `tests/test_verif.py`: `test_verif_scr_<op>()` (if present/needed)
- `tests/test_jit.py`: `test_jit_with_scr_<op>()` (if present/needed)

## Required Return Format

1. Files changed.
2. Soundness results per tested bitwidth (`sound` / `unsound` / `timeout` plus runtime).
3. `eval-final` table values (run with `--exact-bw 7 --norm-bw 64,10000,1000`).
4. Precision and soundness caveats, clearly separating `timeout/unresolved` from `unsound`.
